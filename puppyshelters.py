# Create a function to check a puppy into a shelter, if the shelter is at
# capacity, prompt the user to try a different shelter. If youâ€™re feeling
# extra ambitious write an algorithm that will find another shelter in the
# same area or with a higher vacancy. If all shelters are full, prompt the
# user that a new shelter needs to be opened.

# Feeling Extra Udacious?
# Write a load-balancing algorithm that can transfer puppies evenly throughout
# all the shelters in the database.
